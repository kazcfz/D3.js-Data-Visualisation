# D3.js Data Visualisation 
This project showcases our practices in data visualisation using D3.js, a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualisations in web browsers. Throughout the development of this project, we focused on mastering various types of visualisations, including Pie charts, Donut charts, Stacked Vertical Bar charts, Horizontal Bar charts, and Choropleth Maps.

## Design Principles
Adhering to design principles, including those advocated by Edward Tufte, was a crucial aspect of this project. The visualisations are crafted to effectively communicate information while maintaining clarity and simplicity. The user interface and interaction design prioritize a smooth and intuitive experience.
